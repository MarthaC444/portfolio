notes portfolio

intermediate solution - fix up old fcc portfolio and projects
	get new ones done if possible
	copens need to be commented, and add descriptions of projects, remove unimportant pens

way of "labeling/describing" portfolio items for viewers
problem, solution, outcome
challenge, solution, outcome   give context to the project, the challenge you faced, the solution you came up with, and the outcome of it (post mortem?)

exerpt from Northbeach guide to demonstrate communication skills?

I have three things to go in portfolio: tribute page, survey form, random quote machine
